The order can be determined by tag or list field or other methods.\n\nThe date of events can be stored in a separate field or the `modified` field can be used.\n<<<\n\n!! Syntax\n<<<\n```\n<<timeline-horizontal filter limit:10 template:\"\" footer:\"footer\" \n                      class date:\"modified\" stateTiddler dateformat:\"YYYY\">>\n<<sequence-horizontal filter limit:10 template:\"\" footer:\"footer\" \n                      class date:\"modified\" stateTiddler dateformat:\"mmm DDth YYYY\">>\n\n<<timeline-vertical filter limit:10 template:\"\" footer:\"footer\" class date:\"modified\">>\n<<sequence-vertical filter limit:10 template:\"\" footer:\"footer\" class date:\"modified\">>\n```\n!!

Default field is `modified`|\n|stateTiddler |optional|the name of a state tiddler to keep the state of events. Each call to macro needs a unique state tiddler|\n|dateformat |optional|only in `timeline-horizontal` and `timeline-vertical`, the format for displaying event date.|\n\nMore explanation with examples can be found at [[GitHub demo page|https://kookma.github.io/TW-Timelines/#Filter%20Parameter:%5B%5BFilter%20Parameter%5D%5D%20%5B%5BColor%20classes%5D%5D%20%5B%5BTemplate%20Parameter%5D%5D]].\n\n!!! The dateformat parameter\nThe dateformat lets to customize the event date displayed on the timeline.\n\n;timeline-horizontal\nFor `timeline-horizontal`  macro the default value is `YYYY`,  the other two forms of date are \n\n* `mmm DDth`, and \n* `0DD mmm YYYY`. \n\nOther format will not be displayed!\n\n;timeline-vertical\nFor the `timeline-vertical` macro the default value is `mmm DDth YYYY`,  the other two forms of date are \n\n* `mmm DDth` to show only the month and day and hide year\n* `YYYY` to show only year and hide the month\n\nOther format will not be displayed!\n\n!!! Important note\nWhen the `timeline-horizontal` is used, the timeline at first does not show the event date on the line. This is because the macro uses a state tiddler at first it does not exist. Simply click on pull previous or pull next buttons to create the state tiddler and show the events date. Note that the state tiddlers here are prefixed with `$:/state-tl/ilam` and so when TW closed and reopened the state tiddler will not removed.\n<<<\n\n!

The circle with no colors means no priority!\n\n<$list filter=\"crimson magenta gold limegreen mediumblue none\" variable=\"color\"><$macrocall $name=disp-priority-badge color=<<color>> />\n</$list>\n\nWhen a new item is added to todo list, a grey circle appears right of the task row. No color means no priority. Clicking on this small icon, cycles through colors and you can choose the right color for priority this item has. These are similar to categories.\n<<<\n\n!! Categories\n<<<\nTodolist has several categories and support user categories.

How to use categories\nA category is a simple macro. To use a category use the related macro. Each category macro has a syntax like below:\n\n```\n<<mac-name text:\"your-text-here\">>\n```\n\nFor example to create an item with high priority add new item with the below description (text in textbox)\n\n```\n<<high \"This is a high priority item\">>\n```\nThe current version of Todolist has eight category macros: `high`, `normal`, `low`, `fixme`, `bug`, `tip`, `horn`, and `share`.\n<<<\n\n!!

Archive complete items\n* You can also export done items to archive using <span class=\"kk-doc\">{{$:/plugins/kookma/todolist/images/archive.svg}}</span> button\n* You can navigate to archive and see them as a table\n\n!!!

Mechanism\n<<<\nTrash plugin has two parts\n\n* Move to Trashbin\n* Restore from Trashbin\n\n; By moving a tiddler to Trashbin it means\n\n# A new data tiddler created\n# The title of data tiddler is the title of objective tiddler prefixed with `$:/trashbin/`\n# All the fields of objective tiddler is moved into a new data tiddler\n# The objective tiddler is deleted\n\n\n; By restoring a tiddler from Trashbin, it means\n# A new tiddler is created\n# Its title is taken from the `title` index in data tiddler\n# All other index/value are copied to newly created tiddler fields respectively. This means every index creates a field\n# The data tiddler is deleted\n\n;Duplicates\n# Deleted tiddlers will get numeric suffix if another tiddler with same title is existed in Trashbin.\n# Tiddlers existed in wiki will never overwritten if a tiddler with the same title is tried to be restored. A notification will notify user and operation will be cancelled.\n# Note that, the real title of deleted tiddler is what stored in `title` index of data tiddler NOT the title of data tiddler itself which stores the deleted tiddler in Trashbin.\n<<<\n\n!!
